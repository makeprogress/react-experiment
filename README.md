# react-experiment

> A React component to load Boston experiments and render active or inactive children.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i react-experiment --save-dev
```

## Usage
Please visit the [Boston app online](https://bostonapp.co/). There, you can create an account and an experiment, configure specific users who should see the experiment, or specify a percent of users who should see the experiment.

Once this is complete, copy the experiment id from the experiment card and your API key from settings (KEY and ID below). Next, include the following component in your app:

```js
import React from 'react'
import Experiment from '@boston/react-experiment'

const AlwaysBlue = () => <div>
  <Experiment apiKey="KEY" experimentId="ID">
    <Experiment.Active>
      <span red>JK, I'm red!</span>
    </Experiment.Active>
    <Experiment.Inactive>
      <span red>I'm blue! Huzzah!</span>
    </Experiment.Inactive>
  </Experiment>
</div>

export default AlwaysBlue
```
