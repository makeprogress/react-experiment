# @toggles/react-experiment

A React component to load Toggles experiments and render active or inactive children.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```sh
$ npm i -D @toggles/react-experiment
```

## Usage
Please visit the [Toggles app online](https://toggles.app/). There, you can create an account and an experiment, configure specific users who should see the experiment, or specify a percent of users who should see the experiment.

Once this is complete, copy the experiment id from the experiment card and your API key from settings (KEY and ID below). Next, include the following component in your app:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Experiment from '@toggles/react-experiment'

const AlwaysBlue = () => <div>
  <Experiment 
    alwaysRenderInactive={false}
    apiKey="KEY" 
    context={{uniqueId: "test.user@toggles.app"}}
    experimentId="ID"
    showErrors={false}
    rapidAPIKey="KEY">
    <Experiment.Active>
      <span red>JK, I'm red!</span>
    </Experiment.Active>
    <Experiment.Inactive>
      <span red>I'm blue! Huzzah!</span>
    </Experiment.Inactive>
  </Experiment>
</div>

export default AlwaysBlue
```

**NOTE**: No children passed to the `Experiment` component besides `Active` or `Inactive` will be rendered.

| experimentId                | string        | A Toggles experiment id                        |                               |
| showErrors                  | bool          | Specifies whether API errors should be shown   | `false`                       |

`context` is either of type `shape`, which supports a single property, `uniqueId`, or a string. This property represents identifying information about a user and may be used to blacklist or whitelist active experiment users.

**NOTE**: If you pass a RapidAPI Key it will be used with preference to the Toggles API Key.
